The year is 2177. 
Space colonizing technology is still in its infancy; nevertheless, the Special Operations Exploration Team of Exomer751 is embarked on a reconnaissance mission to the newly discovered planet Secturn.  Their mission is to rendezvous with cargo pods that await them on the surface of Secturn. The Cargo pods are stocked with enough supplies and equipment to serve as a makeshift base of operations, code named RX-2020. The crew is to establish a base at RX-2020 where they can then begin their job of surveying, researching, and mapping the planet’s surface in preparation for colonization.
