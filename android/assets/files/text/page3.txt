Thankful to be alive, the surviving members of Exomer751 try to scrape together what supplies they can. With few supplies, no working communications, and one mostly functioning ROV, the crew is forced to attempt to travel to the RX-2020 by ROV, deploy the Long-range Coms, and await further instructions. 
The ship’s last coordinates place the crew (TOTAL MILES) away from the RX-2020.
